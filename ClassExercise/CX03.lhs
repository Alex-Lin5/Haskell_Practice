This exercise refers to the model calligraphic M given in (ACST) Example 2.8 (page 25), Example 2.12 and 2.15.  That is:
calligraphic M equals left parenthesis W subscript 1 comma I subscript 1 comma J subscript 1 right parenthesis
where the collection of  propositional symbols P r o p V a r the function $I_1$ and relation $J_1$ is given in the exercise description.
Practice questions:
1. Draw the graph for the model calligraphic M.  Note: This is exactly the graph we sketched in yesterday's lecture (Lecture 9).
2. First review the examples 2.12 and 2.15 carefully.  Afterwards, follow the definition of the evaluation function E subscript calligraphic M (ACST, Figure 2.1
to compute 
a.  E subscript calligraphic M left parenthesis left parenthesis q logical or r right parenthesis superset of s right parenthesis
b. Use the result from Exercise 2.15 to compute E subscript calligraphic M left parenthesis A l i c e space c o n t r o l s space left parenthesis q superset of left parenthesis r logical and s right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesis.
